# heat-exchanger-network-pinch
A novel way to do find pinch temperature where the user specifies the Supply Temperature, Target Temperature, and Thermal Capacity from an excel file alongside a DeltaTmin and the program generates Hot Composite Curve, Cold Composite Curve, Grand Composite Curve, Heat Cascade Table, Temperature Interval Diagram, Minimum Hot Utility required, Minimum Cold Utility required, Pinch Temperature, and the Pinch in the grid representation
